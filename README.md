# TictactoePro

## Description

In this website you can play Tic-tac-toe against a AI player that never loses so the best you can get is a tie.

The technologies used were `Node.js` along with HTML/CSS. This ideia emerged while I was in my Artificial Intelligence class learning about MINIMAX algorithm so I thought would be a good side project.

The AI player follows the [Alpha-beta purning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) algorithm so it always chooses the best play available.

I wasn't happy with my AI algorithm part of the project and The Coding Train [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) on Youtube helped me develop a better solution.
